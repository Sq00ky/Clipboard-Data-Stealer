Yeah.... I couldn't think of a cool name so I went with "Clipboard Data Stealer". It's short, sweet, says what it does.

### About This Program
This is a basic program that copies clipboard data using the OpenClipboard, GetClipboardData and CloseClipboard Windows APIs. It consistantly monitors for new text copied and sends a GET request to a web server using URLOpenBlockingStreamA Windows API.
There isn't all that much more to say than that other than I am **not** responsible for what you do with this program. It is categorized as malware and should not be used on any production system. Only in a lab environment. If you do bad things with this program, that's on you. I will not be providing a release to prevent abuse of this tool.
With that said, please use this program responsibily <3

### Compilation Instructions
This code can be compiled with Visual Studio Code 2019 as a 32-bit or 64-bit program. Before compiling, ensure you set the IP Address or Domain Name in the URL string to a device you control or else data will not be logged. Who needs disk-based artifacts!? It's 2022!

### Known Issues
Currently, non-ascii data (ex. Pictures) will crash the program. I have no idea why. Maybe I'll fix it one day? I'm not exactly sure what's wrong :(
